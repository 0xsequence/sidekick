# Sequence Sidekick üßë‚Äçüíª

Sidekick is a companion service, fully open source,that simplifies blockchain interactions for your applications and games. It provides a RESTful API for executing sponsored transactions, managing smart contracts, and handling common Web3 operations without exposing private keys or complex blockchain logic to your frontend.

When executing any transaction with Sidekick, the msg.sender will not be the EOA of the PRIVATE KEY you're using for Sidekick, but a Sequence Smart Wallet address created for your EOA.
You can get the address by making a GET request to the `/sidekick/wallet-address` endpoint.
