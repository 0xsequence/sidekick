# Sequence Sidekick üßë‚Äçüíª

Sidekick is a companion service, fully open source,that simplifies blockchain interactions for your applications and games. It provides a RESTful API for executing sponsored transactions, managing smart contracts, and handling common Web3 operations without exposing private keys or complex blockchain logic to your frontend.

When executing any transaction with Sidekick, the caller will not be the EOA of the PRIVATE KEY you're using for Sidekick, but a Sequence Smart Wallet created for your EOA.
You can get the address by making a GET request to the `/sidekick/wallet-address` endpoint.

## Run with Docker from GitHub Container Registry

These commands will get you started with the simplest version of Sidekick. It will allow you to test some of the features like deploying a contract, reading from a contract and executing transactions.

Go to [Sequence Builder](https://sequence.build/), login or signup, create a project, go to "Embedded Wallet" and copy your "Project Access Key"

```
docker run -p 7500:7500 -e SEQUENCE_PROJECT_ACCESS_KEY=... ghcr.io/0xsequence/sidekick:latest
```

If you don't provide an BACKEND_WALLET_PV_KEY environment variable, a temporary dev private key will be generated for you inside a dev.key file, you can keep using this for developemnt and testing but DO NOT USE THIS FOR PRODUCTION.

üö® We recommend to not use a local signer for production, use AWS KMS or Google KMS instead. 

## Run locally with Docker Compose

You can use the docker-compose.yml to run Sidekick with all the features like Redis, PostgreSQL, Grafana, Prometheus, Blackbox Exporter, etc.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

This will start all the services.
```
pnpm docker:start
```

## Dev mode

You can also run Sidekick locally without docker.
  
```
cp .env.example .env
```

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev:withRedis
```

## Analytics & Monitoring üìä

Sidekick provides several tools for monitoring, metrics, and alerting. Here's where to find each:

### Grafana Dashboard
- **Purpose:** Visualize metrics and monitor the health and performance of Sidekick services.
- **Access:** [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- **Default Login:**  
  - **Username:** `admin`  
  - **Password:** `admin`
- **Note:** Grafana is pre-configured to use Prometheus as a data source. Dashboards are provisioned from `monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards`.

### Metrics Endpoint (Prometheus Scrape Target)
- **Purpose:** Exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics for Sidekick.
- **Access:** [http://localhost:7500/metrics](http://localhost:7500/metrics)
- **Note:** This endpoint is scraped by Prometheus (see `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml` for config).

### Prometheus
- **Purpose:** Query, visualize, and explore collected metrics.
- **Access:** [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
- **Note:** Prometheus is configured via `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml` and alert rules in `monitoring/prometheus/alerts.yml`.

### Prometheus Alerts (Alertmanager)
- **Purpose:** View and manage alerting rules and notifications.
- **Access:** [http://localhost:9093](http://localhost:9093)
- **Note:** Alertmanager is configured via `monitoring/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`.

### Blackbox Exporter
- **Purpose:** Probe endpoints over HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and ICMP for uptime and latency monitoring.
- **Access:** [http://localhost:9115](http://localhost:9115)
- **Note:** Used by Prometheus for external endpoint checks.

### DEBUG mode üêõ

Sidekick provides a DEBUG mode that will give you detailed logs so you can see what's happening under the hood, add DEBUG="true" as an environment variable to your .env file to turn it on.

```
DEBUG=true
```

### Tenderly üîç

Sidekick is integrated with Tenderly, you can use it to simulate transactions, deployments, or get a transaction simulation URL and debug directly from the Tenderly UI with just one click. For the best results, we recommend that your contracts are verified.
To use Tenderly, you need to add the following environment variables to your .env file:

```
TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY=...
TENDERLY_ACCOUNT_SLUG=..
TENDERLY_PROJECT_SLUG=..
```

### Contract Verification ‚úÖ

Sidekick automatically verifies contracts at deployment time, it checks if a contract is already verified, if not it will verify it.
For now, this only works for the following contracts:

- ERC20 (/deploy/erc20/:chainId)
- ERC721 (/deploy/erc721/:chainId)
- ERC1155 (/deploy/erc1155/:chainId)

To turn automatic verification on you need the following environment variables:

```
VERIFY_CONTRACT_ON_DEPLOY=true
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=..  .
```

Verification for other contract templates will be added soon.
